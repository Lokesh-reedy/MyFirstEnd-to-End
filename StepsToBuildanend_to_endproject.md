when we create a readme.md file
to create a readme.md go to stackedit.io and write you mardown syntaxx there

when a client gives you a project you should first build the backend
1>after creating backend folder initialize you  node 
because you need package.json file,it contains all the used pacakages and scripts
>npm init -y
this will give you package.json
after thsi
>npm i express
after installing express you can see that there is a dependencies added to your package.json file
this is the place where all the external dependencies used will be mentioned
now you can see node_modules which has many libraries including express aand which is very heavy

you can delete node_modules if you not running your program as it is heavy,to get it back 
run >npm install
this checks the dependecies in package.json and installs all the dependecies
you never send node_modules to some you send all other files including package.json the person in his cmp installs node modules
after creating server.js and writting the boilerplate the next step is zod
create types.js and add all the zod/input you want to get
for database create a db folder and create a js file and write your code/define the schemma there

come back to end to end folder
and initial a react app there called frontend
create a folder named component in the source and create you component file over there remember the file name should start with capital letter ex CreateTodo.jsx
